## Instructor: [Jeremy McPeak][instructor url]

React is one of the most popular web frameworks. And let's be honest: there are tons of tutorials and articles out there to help you get started with React. But this course is a little different, because in it, you're going to learn React by writing components that you could incorporate into your own applications. Along the way, you'll learn all the basics of coding React components. You'll learn about JSX, events, managing state and passing props. You'll also learn about some other key concepts like higher-order components, lifecycle methods, and using third-party libraries.
